<p>Discipline is described as adhering to or obeying a set of rules. Our lives become more organised when we follow those rules. Working as per the rules is a lot of fun and makes everything normal and straightforward. That’s why there is a determined effort to maintain discipline in institutions like schools. A disciplined person is obedient to the proper authority and also has self-governing behaviour. Being disciplined is essential in all aspects of life and is required for every endeavour. This is necessary for everyone to collaborate on a project. If we do not follow our superiors’ directions and rules, we will face challenges, and our efforts may fail. Maintaining our daily routines like waking up early in the morning, having water as required and freshening up before starting our day – all account to leading a disciplined life. </p><br> 
<b>Human beings are the most important components of every social framework, and <i> Rules and Laws are required for any system to function.</i> A system or an individual is considered to be disciplined when these norms regulate human behaviour and create a sense of organisation. Every facet of human life, as well as other kinds of life, benefits from discipline. It instils a sense of accountability and credibility and encourages people to take responsibility for their actions.</b> <br><br>
<small>Discipline may be found everywhere, from a sportsperson’s daily routine to a businessperson’s regular schedule or a child’s first steps. However, it is equally crucial to recognise that the same set of rules does not apply to everyone. A disciplinary regimen should always be constructed to fulfil individual requirements first, unlike “terms and conditions” that set out their own demands.</small>
