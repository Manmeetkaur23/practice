			<p class="h6">Flowers like the Rose, the Jasmine, the Bela, and the Rajanigandha are very sweet smelling. While they are in bloom, they scatter their fragrance around and act as a healing balm to all bruised hearts. Some common flowers like the Lotus, the marigold, the sunflowers, etc. are really beautiful to look at.A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Flowers are, therefore, a perennial source of joy to men. They are not only things of beauty but also useful for the supply of honey which is both food and medicine. Bees gather honey from flowers and store it up in their hives from which men get honey.
